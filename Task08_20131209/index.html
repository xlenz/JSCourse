          Multiply your anger by about a hundred, kate, that's how much he thinks he loves you. the man likes to play chess; let's get him some rocks. well, what is it today? more spelunking? cities fall but they are rebuilt. heroes die but they are remembered. i now issue a new commandment: thou shalt do the dance. cities fall but they are rebuilt. heroes die but they are remembered. mister wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing, when i'm asked, i don't have to lie. but don't think of me as an idiot. bruce... i'm god. i don't think they tried to market it to the billionaire, spelunking, base-jumping crowd. i did the same thing to gandhi, he didn't eat for three weeks. you measure yourself by the people who measure themselves by you. that tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his ass.

          You are as precious to me as you were to your own mother and father. i swore to them that i would protect you, and i haven't. your were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off. at this point, i'd set you up with a chimpanzee if it'd brought you back to the world! my lord! you're a tripod. you're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off! you know, your bobby dangler, giggle stick, your general-two-colonels, master of ceremonies... yeah, don't be shy, let's have a look. i took a viagra, got stuck in me throat, i've had a stiff neck for hours. pull my finger! jasper: your baby is the miracle the whole world has been waiting for. it's not the size mate, it's how you use it. when i get back, remind to tell you about the time i took 100 nuns to nairobi! i want to shoot the pigeons... off my roof.
